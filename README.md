# place

Created a Travel based app on Django Framework.

Added some destinations with their price and descriptions.

And you will find a register and login to the page.

You can Check localhost:8000/admin
where it will be asked for login and password.

my credentials is admin:navneet and password is 1234

I have also connected with postgresql for database.
